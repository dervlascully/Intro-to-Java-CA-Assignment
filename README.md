# Intro-to-Java-CA-Assignment

2nd Year Semester 1.
See pdf report

Task:
For this assignment, you should answer the sample exam question present on Moodle (see sample exam question pdf) three times such that you would expect:
1. the first solution receive a B grade or higher, 
2. the second solution receive a C grade,
3. the third solution receive a D grade.
All parts of all three solutions must
• compile
• be free of arithmetic errors, intentional logical errors, and infinite loops
• be complete, i.e. an answer must be provided to parts a, b, c, and d. You cannot differentiate the quality of the solution based on part e.
To substantiate your claim on the quality of the solutions, prepare and execute ONE set of JUnit tests that evidences the rank order of your solutions. All three solutions should be tested with the same set of unit tests.
You can have three JUnit test .java files, if needed. However, all methods with a @Test annotation must be the same.
